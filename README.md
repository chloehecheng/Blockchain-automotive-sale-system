A project for developing a blockchain smart contract to sell second-hand vehicles.

The second-hand vehicle market is booming in recent years due to the relatively low price and good conditions of used cars. However, there are about 120,000 cases of auto fraud that took place in the US in 2020. This is mainly because the traditional platform makes fraud easier. The most common fraud is to hide or manipulate the vehicle’s history in order to sell the car for a higher price. This is also why buyers must be more cautious when buying a used vehicle through traditional platforms.
